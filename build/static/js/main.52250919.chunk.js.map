Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>\r\n                                                        </div>\r\n                                                    </div> */}\r\n                                                    <div className=\"collection-product-wrapper\">\r\n                                                        <div className=\"product-top-filter\">\r\n                                                            <div className=\"container-fluid p-0\">\r\n                                                                <div className=\"row\">\r\n                                                                    <div className=\"col-xl-12\">\r\n                                                                        <div className=\"filter-main-btn\">\r\n                                                                            <span onClick={this.openFilter}\r\n                                                                                className=\"filter-btn btn btn-theme\"><i\r\n                                                                                    className=\"fa fa-filter\"\r\n                                                                                    aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Filter</span>\r\n                                                                        </div>\r\n                                                                    </div>\r\n                                                                </div>\r\n                                                                <div className=\"row\">\r\n                                                                    <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n                                                                        <FilterBar onLayoutViewClicked={(colmuns) => this.LayoutViewClicked(colmuns)} />\r\n                                                                    </div>\r\n                                                                </div>\r\n                                                            </div>\r\n                                                        </div>\r\n\r\n                                                        {/*Products Listing Component*/}\r\n                                                        {/* <ProductListing colSize={this.state.layoutColumns} /> */}\r\n                                                        <div className=\"product-wrapper-grid\">\r\n                                                            <div className=\"container-fluid\">\r\n                                                                {this.state.products.length > 0 ?\r\n                                                                    <InfiniteScroll\r\n                                                                        dataLength={this.state.limit} //This is important field to render the next data\r\n                                                                        next={this.fetchMoreItems}\r\n                                                                        hasMore={this.state.hasMoreItems}\r\n                                                                        loader={<div className=\"loading-cls\"></div>}\r\n                                                                        endMessage={\r\n                                                                            <p className=\"seen-cls seen-it-cls\">\r\n                                                                                <b>Yay!

so\r\n                                    beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by\r\n                                    desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and\r\n                                    equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which\r\n                                    is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are\r\n                                    perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice\r\n                                    is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,\r\n                                    every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain\r\n                                    circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will\r\n                                    frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The\r\n                                    wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he\r\n                                    rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to\r\n                                    avoid worse pains.</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n
